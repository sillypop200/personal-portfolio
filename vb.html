        <p class = "topmeow"> One of my most niche interests is being obsessed with Nebraska's Women's Volleyball team. I could confidently name all players and their position on the team. I always try my best 
          to watch their games on Fox Sports and I am SO excited for the NCAA tournament in December. They are a part of the BIG10, so they will probably come play at UMich next year and I will be there fangirling in Nebraska merch. 
        <br><br> One of the biggest games of the year in women's volleyball is Nebraska and Wisconsin, both representing red and white. This year, they played each other twice; the most recent game being on November 23, 2024. Check out below to see my breakdown of this highly anticipated game!

          <h2 id ="sapa"> Nebraska Women's Volleyball Team </h2>
        <p> The Nebraska Women's Volleyball Team is one of the most successful programs in NCAA volleyball history, with more wins than any other program and five national championships. Nebraska has been ranked in every weekly poll since the introduction of the AVCA National Poll in 1982 and has spent more weeks ranked number one than any other program.
          On August 30, 2023, Nebraska played at Memorial Stadium in front of 92,003 people, the highest-attended women's sporting event in the United States. This year, they are highly favored to win the national championship. My favorite player on this team is Harper Murray, an Ann Arbor native. Her story is incredible and she is such a well-rounded player.

        <h2 id="dsd"> Wisconsin Women's Volleyball Team  </h2>
        <p> The Wisconsin Women's Volleyball Team won the Big10 Conference for four straight years from 2019-2022, winning the national championship in 2021. The University of Wisconsin has a rich volleyball tradition, with origins dating back to 1974.Current Nebraska head coach, John Cook, was actually head coach 
          of the Wisconsin program from 1992-1998. A standout player on this team is Sarah Franklin, a 6'4 outside hitter. Named AVCA National Player of the Year in 2023, she is a heavy-hitter for this team.

        <h2 id="charli"> Their History </h2></a>
        <p> Nebraska and Wisconsin have one of the best women's college volleyball rivalries. Out of the past nine NCAA championship matches, six have featured the Wisconsin badgers or the Nebraska Cornhuskers. 
          The two teams did meet earlier this year on November 1, 2024 at the UW Fieldhouse. Before this season, Nebraska hasn't beat the Badgers in the UW Fieldhouse since 2013. However, this year, Nebraska <strong>SWEPT</strong> Wisconsin in 3 sets. 
          This game will be a rematch at the Devaney Center, home to the Nebraska Cornhuskers, and will either solidify #2 Nebraska's dominance or be a revenge match for #6 Wisconsin.

        <p> Once again, the Nebraska Cornhuskers swept the Wisconsin Badgers 3-0 (25-21, 25-22, 25-17). Nebraska led in kills and digs with 47 and 54 respectively, while Wisconsin had 34 and 37. Nebraska had a hitting percentage of 0.259 and Wisconsin had a percentage of 0.169. 
          A standout player in this game was Nebraska Cornhusker, Rebekah Allick who had 10 kills and was hitting at 0.667. This game put Wisconsin out of the running for the Big10 title, but I am excited to see if they will meet during tournament play.
