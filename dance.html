        <p class = "topmeow"> Over the past years, dancing has quickly become a big passion of mine. On campus, I am a part of Michigan Wolveraas, which is the University of Michigan's competitive Raas-Garba dance team (pictured on the left). During first semester, we work hard learning our set and building our props, and during second semester, we polish up our set and get to travel around the US at competitions, showcasing what we have been building!
         I have also grown to appreciate other dance team's dance sets, dance performances on my Tik Tok page, and watching Dancing with the Stars!
        <br><br> Below, you can check out my current top 4 favorite dance sets!

          <h2 id ="sapa"> RU SAPA's 2024 Charlie in the Chocolate Factory </h2></a>
        <p> The first time I watched this dance set, I was so creeped out by the plot twist that I had to FaceTime my friend. Often, in fusion dance sets like these, 
          I might find the story line hard to follow, but each segment in this spin on Charlie in the Chocolate Factory captured my attention and embodied the plot so well. 
          My favorite segment in this set is Violet Beauregarde's all-girls section to "Monster" by Nicki Minaj. I don't normally love all-girls segments, but this one was SO GOOD.

        <h2 id="dsd"> DSD's 2024 Kung Fu Panda </h2></a>
        <p> During my first ever dance competition with Michigan Wolveraas, I was able to see this set's debut. No one knew what their theme was going to be, and DSD (Dirty South Daniya)
        is a big name in the Raas Circuit. I particularly really loved the props: the beautiful cherry blossom trees, the temple in the background, and the lanterns hanging above. 
        I also loved the incorporation of East Asian sounds or Kung Fu Panda music into their mix. My favorite segment in this set is the very final segment. It just felt ETHEREAL and 
        I loved the way they hit their dandiya on the floor in unison.

        <h2 id="charli"> Charli D'Amelio and Mark Ballas' Viennese Waltz</h2></a>
        <p> I am not afraid to admit that I am an avid Charli D'Amelio defender since she first started getting famous, so she was my ULTIMATE favorite to win when she was on season 31 of Dancing with the Stars.
          From the beginning of the season, she absolutely KILLED her dances, and by the end, she looked like a pro. This dance is my favorite of hers this season; her and Mark danced with such GRACE. I could watch this one
          over and over again. I love the song choice, the way their costumes complemented each other, and how her dress flowed with all her movements. My absolute favorite part is when her and Mark spun in unison (timestamp 0:33). 
          You can see the judges throw up their hands in awe, and that is very representative of how I feel when I watch this dance.

        <h2 id="ohio">Ohio State Dance Team 2024 - JAZZ FINALS - UDA College Nationals</h2></a>
        <p> This dance was floating all over my Tik Tok For You Page when the UDA College Nationals Competition was happening. The thing that I loved most about this performance was 
          the emotion and musicality behind it. Their movements really embodied the lyrics in the song "My Way" and I could honestly tear up from this dance. My favorite aspects of this dance 
          was how they incorporated their costume. I loved when they used their ties or slapped then threw their jackets on the floor. This dance was just so beautifully executed, I was in awe.  </p>
